# Track-Simulation-of-Electric-Vehicle-A-Lap-Optimization-Approach-
This project focuses to develop a comprehensive model that replicates the behavior of electric vehicles (EVs) under various circuit conditions and velocity profiles. The model is designed to simulate the dynamic interactions between powertrain components, vehicle dynamics, and external factors, enabling detailed performance analysis and optimization for diverse scenarios. 
This project aims to develop a simulation-based framework to optimize the powertrain parameters of electric vehicles (EVs) under varying track and environmental conditions. By simulating lap times on racing circuits, the project focuses on identifying configurations that maximize performance and adaptability across diverse scenarios.
The project includes:
Vehicle Dynamics Modelling, Tire Modelling and Powertrain Modelling-> (motor and battery)
