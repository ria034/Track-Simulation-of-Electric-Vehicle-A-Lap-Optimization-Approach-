# Track-Simulation-of-Electric-Vehicle-A-Lap-Optimization-Approach-
This project focuses on developing dual track electric vehicle model. 
This project aims to develop a simulation-based framework to optimize the powertrain parameters of electric vehicles (EVs) under varying track and environmental conditions. By simulating lap times on racing circuits, the project focuses on identifying configurations that maximize performance and adaptability across diverse scenarios.
The project includes:
Vehicle Dynamics Modelling, Tire Modelling and Powertrain Modelling-> (motor and battery)
